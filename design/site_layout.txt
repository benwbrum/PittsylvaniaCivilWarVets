Site design for Pittsylvania County Civil War Veterans


Navigation modes:
Search
Browse
Analyze


Analyze should let researchers (at minimum) re-execute the queries
Jeff used for the book, comparing before/after valuations.  

Search will be a basic search over the three record sets, likely just
on name fields.  Likely use case is an alternative for
FamilySearch/Ancestry/HeritageQuest -- nothing ground-breaking here,
but useful as an entry point for people exploring.

Browse should let people navigate through lists of occupations, sexes,
ages, etc, allowing researchers to navigate from records to lists and
lists to records, as well as (in some cases) from record to record.
